        <p class="font-semibold text-indigo-300">Let's clear up some misconceptions</p>
        <p>I am neither a Python developer, a backend developer, nor a Flutter developer or mobile developer. If you believe I am, it's due to my past work experience. You might wonder: what or who am I, then?</p>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-4">My name is Deepesh Kalura. I am someone who communicates with computers. You might ask, "For whom do I communicate?" The answer is: I communicate for myself, my family, friends, or anyone who wants to hire me.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">I have a certain belief: in my entire life, I will hardly have 6-7 projects where I really work as an engineer. That's why I'm very selective about which projects I choose.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Therefore, I work with people who have deep domain knowledge about their field and a desire to solve challenging problems within it. I don't mind whether the domain is technical or not. If communicating with computers is required to solve the problem, then it's a worthwhile and exciting opportunity.</p>
        <div class="bg-emerald-900 bg-opacity-30 border-l-4 border-emerald-500 p-4 my-6 rounded-r">
        <p>If you meet these conditions — if you're building something amazing and have extensive domain knowledge — then just talk to me. What are you waiting for?</p>
