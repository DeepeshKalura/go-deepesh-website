          What is experience? This is such a deep question that i will have to create a new section just to convey this message but I believe experience is a conscious event undertaken to acquire knowledge, particularly regarding its content.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4"> 
          Projects, working within a company, and helping others with their communication contribute to one's overall experience. Freelancing, internships, and even developing personal projects are also valuable aspects of my experience, especially in relation to working with companies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          I have invested effort in both the projects I have failed and those I have succeeded in. Some of these projects required extensive research rather than coding, and even my unsuccessful research papers are part of my journey toward understanding the subject.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4"> 
          Aren't all these endeavours conscious events aimed at acquiring knowledge? Therefore, I see all these experiences as stepping stones toward better communication with computers.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300">
          However, I still choose to showcase only the companies I have worked for. As a result, my six years of experience feel like they've reset to zero because I am still a college student.

                During my three-month internship, I was responsible for managing the mobile application and the backend, which is written in PHP Laravel. While I have a year of self-taught backend development experience, I faced the challenge of creating a backend from Laravel without prior professional experience.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-200 mb-4">
                Throughout this time, I learned a new language, built various functionalities, and solved bugs on the go. Here is a list of my work:
              </p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-200">
                <li>Managed the display of local time for users, as our backend stored data in the Africa time zone, but users needed to see it in their local time (e.g., Indian IST).</li>
                <li>Created an admin system to grant subscription access to users.</li>
                <li>Handled the migration of data and the restructuring of therapy session purchase records in the existing database, as well as created payment functionality with Stripe.</li>
                <li>Improved the webRTC functionality.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-gray-200 mt-4">
                These were the areas in which I worked, and I solved numerous bugs during this internship.
