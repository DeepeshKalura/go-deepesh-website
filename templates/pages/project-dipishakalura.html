                My sister wanted to write a story and decided she would publish all her books on her website, soooo üòÆ‚Äçüí® she ordered me to make her website.  I don't know what her grand vision is for her website.

             I don't know what I am doing or how I can help here, but I am sure I  wanna support her in her vision!!!  As for now, I am the maintainer of her project. I hope I can support in her with her future endeavours closely.

            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              To be honest, I don't know what I learned at this point from this project!! As my heart is frozen related to software development, and I know one things that i can build anything my heart desires,  no matter how complicated and hard it its. Maybe this project just refuelled my thought process. I am sure this project will challenge and help me grow like never before.
