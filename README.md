# Deepesh's Go Website

Previously my website was created with the pure html and it was the first time, not about html just doing web and i was like doing the flutter development for 1 year by that time. I was asking my firends for building website ok, it was distreoes experience. I don't like building website at first it was the borning that why i switch to the android development i was like a little kid thinks that hey they all are different but that was not the case. Know I know it all part of the bigger pictire of changingn the pexles. So, there is everything feel borning about the frontend even building tools for frontend or even backend s suoer boraning ok. One ore reason will be like this people just want smething else ok. 


So, many people or firends said they will build m person website and i was happy with my things. But they didn't make and i remeber  but at the end they didn't make it. So, i last time i did my website in the 7 class. After this for earlier version of the website. 

I really laugh when people said using components and making decent looking website lol. It is just mid landing page now, I know why so my first website making lots of fun even the chatgpt is there but i amnot using it why i am stupide and i don't remeber but it will be as stupid that why use the chatgpt so, i was manually writing the css and html and it was taking lot
s of time and lot's of time but now i know it was bad and why it was bad idea. 


So, that website last for 1 year because i ddin't want to change the things i learn about cool concpets. I take time what i wanted to present and how i presented is two diffferent things. So, I write conent lke in this read me file i write conent with my hear open no claoing of the things ok. THat makes my conent i can published and foucs of the time. So, creation conent is different the how it presentation and how it reaches and thus my new perceptation makes. Making website more funs.

So, with new perceptation i will make the things off the new webssite ok.


Why I choose the go and htmx. 

Recently i make the react my bitch here the article. I know the language but that time it was past deepesh mood like this. In jan 2025. It took me understand react then i create my sister website with the next js. I created one website with the react but i forgot. Yeah I remeber it is for the rovaa. God knows or how many website i have created. 

I want server side work this is must. So I make a list of programming language and choose random with python fucntion. I go in the interpeater. Yes I can do that no chatgpt madeness code and choose random of with compedetion of the c++, c, zig, go and rust ok. and go won.  I see that some case htmx. that why i choose to extend functionality otherwsise i have to use javascript and i don't want to use the javascript for this website. I said fuck you react. Fuck you react. I know it concept but same things i can do for now the with the template. 

But again it is not show shining things, I can choose because my website has every less work or the things i really fucking the components. And it is not like react components ok. 


So, I was like like it is important to do things really well. But in this website i think i can make 1000 postive impress and lots of secrets are making site more existing that my plan. I will be very clear what i want to do.


Note i am writing this with pure thoughts o it will be all over place. Bascially i am closing my eyes and typing it. So, i don't want you read it but it is kinda pure thoughs i will update it no issue and make it better ok.
